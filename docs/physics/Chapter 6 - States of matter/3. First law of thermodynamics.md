First, some definitions. 

The internal energy U of an object (or system): sum of all kinetic energies, kinetic and potential of all the microscopic constituents of said object, seen in the reference frame of the center of mass.

In the simple example of a mono-atomic gas (think helium) we have $U=N\lt E_{kin,cm}\gt=N\cdot3\cdot \frac{1}{2}kT$.

For a more complex case, like a diatomic gas (think water vapor): we have translation (movement side to side) and rotation (movement round and round.
$U=N(3+2) \frac{1}{2}kT$


The heat Q is the energy echanged between the system (the object) and it's environment (in a form other than work of a macroscopic force.)
