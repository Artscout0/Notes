As we all know, matter is made of atoms.
In Newtonian mechanics, a good image is to consider atoms as small balls interacting with each other.

An object (bit of matter) of mass m taking up a volume V, is either going to be homogeneous (so $\rho$ is the same everywhere), non homogeneous ($\rho$ is different everywhere).
