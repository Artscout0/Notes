The movement of an object can only be given in comparison to another object, a so called reference object.

Example:

Image a person in a train, that is running on time.

As reference, we have multiple options.

If we take the ground, well, the person is moving fast.
If however we take the train as a reference, the person isn't moving.

This means that depending on the chosen reference, the movement is different.

Now, in any of those references, we need a point O, the origin, that is part of the reference.
In order to calculate (make projections), we need to link the reference to a fixed frame of reference ($O, \vec{e_x}, \vec{e_y}$ ), which is usually chosen to be orthonormal, ortho meaning that $\vec{e_x}\perp\vec{e_y}$, or that the basis vectors are perpendicular, and normal meaning $||\vec{e_x}||=1=||\vec{e_y}||$.

We typically make them horizontal-vertical, where $||\vec{e_y}||$ is vertical and $||\vec{e_x}||$ is horizontal.
