So, we're previously defined instant speed, but let's recap:

As $P_2\rightarrow P_1$, $\Delta\vec{r}$ becomes the director vector, of the tangent of $\Gamma$ at point $P_1$.

As $\Delta t$ (and therefore $\Delta\vec{r}$) become "infinitely small", we define the (instant) speed of the object at moment t (t being the time where the object is at $P_1$ of it's trajectory):

$$
\vec{v}(t)=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\vec{r}(t+\Delta t)-\vec{r}(t)}{\Delta t}=\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}=\dot{\vec{r}}
$$


In other terms, we say (at $\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$) that instant speed is the derivative of $\vec{r}$ according to time. $\dot{\vec{r}}$ is simply a shorter notation of the same.


This allows us to prove the things asserted in [[3. Position vector, and time#Specific movements|the specific movement part of the previous page]], but I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader as it isn't exactly interesting or complicated.

This also allows us to properly define speed as
- **the variation of the position in relation to time;**
- A vector;
- Tangent to the trajectory in the direction of movement;
- A function on time ($\vec{v}=\vec{v}(t)$)
