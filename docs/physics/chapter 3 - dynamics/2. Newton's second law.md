If an object in motion is acted upon iff ($\iff$) it's speed changes

It's a bit better known under it's mathematical formulation:

$$
\vec{F}=m\vec{a}
$$

Where:
- $\vec{F}$ is the sum of the forces acting on the object
- m is the object's mass (NOT WEIGHT)
- $\vec{a}$ is the object's acceleration

As mass is always positive, not only will the sum of forces be // to the acceleration, but also pointing in the same direction. 

This allows us to have a better name for the action that modifies or the lack of which doesn't modify the speed: Force.

Force is measured in Newtons [^1], and in base SI unit's it's $kg \frac{m}{s^2}$
