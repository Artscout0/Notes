Newton [^1] also had a hand in physics [^2].

Here's his first law:

An object in motion doesn't feel an action iff ($\iff$) it's movement is rectilinear, and uniform. ($\vec{a}=\vec{0}$)


This is also called the principle of inertia [^3]

An example is if I throw something in outer space, it won't stop[^4]

Another way to formulate this is "an object in motion stays in motion". 

You'd think this would be obvious....


Anyhow, we need to talk about inertial reference frames, which are, shocker, frames of reference where the principle of inertia is correct. We also call these reference frames Galileans[^5].

[^1]:The bastard I've mentioned a couple times that invented everything that Euler didn't in Mathematics

[^2]:Hence why we call the stuff we do Newtonian Mechanics.

[^3]:Much better name imo, partly because it doesn't mention Newton.

[^4]:No, shut up general relativity, I do not care.

[^5]:Finally someone who isn't Newton. Gosh
