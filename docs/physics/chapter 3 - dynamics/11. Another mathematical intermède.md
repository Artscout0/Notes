## Here's some additional math you should know for all this

The scalar product of two vectors is really important.
You can read more about it [[2. Scalar product|here]].

The rate of change of a product is as important.
It's found using $\frac{d}{dt}=\lim\limits_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{\Delta(AB)}{\Delta t}=\dot{A}B+A\dot{B}$

This allows our previously mentioned acceleration in a circle to do some interesting stuff.

We know that $\vec{a}=\dot{v}$, and that our speed is $v\vec{e}_{t}$. This means through the previous equation to write $\vec{a}=\dot{\vec{v}}=\dot{v}\vec{e_{t}}+v\dot{\vec{e}}$. 

If we're in a circle, the $||\vec{e}_{t}||^{2}=\vec{e_{t}}\cdot\vec{e_{t}}=1$, which means it's variation is 0. This means $\dot{\vec{e}}$ is either null or normal to $\vec{e_{t}}$.

tldr, look [here](https://moodle.epfl.ch/pluginfile.php/2395395/mod_resource/content/1/intermedes.pdf).
