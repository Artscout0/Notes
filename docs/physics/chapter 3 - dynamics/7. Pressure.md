Take the surface of an object. Say there's a force $\vec{F}$ that is being exerted on said surface.

This force can be decomposed into a tangent and normal force: $\vec{F}=\vec{F}_{n}+\vec{F}_{t}$ We can ignore the tangent one.

We call the pressure: $P_{avg}=\frac{||\vec{F}_{n}||}{S}$, measured in $Nm^{-2}$, called Pa or pascals (after [Blaise Pascal](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blaise-Pascal), some French guy).

Some other units worth remembering are bars and atmospheres, where 1 bar is 100000 Pa, and 1 atm is about 101325 Pa.

It's the representation of the normal force on the surface S of the object.

Local pressure is $p=p(\vec{r},t)=\lim\limits_{\Delta s\to0} \frac{||\Delta\vec{F}_{n}||}{\Delta s}=\frac{d\vec{F}n}{ds}$

A particular case is when the normal force is uniformally spread out on the surface S, where the pressure is identical on whatever point you check, and equal to the average pressure.

One pressure we know well is the atmospheric pressure. Another one is societal pressure, but we're in physics not sociology..
