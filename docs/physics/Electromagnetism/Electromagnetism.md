# Electromagnetism

Electromagnetism deals with **electric charges**, **magnetic fields**, and how they interact. It’s one of the four fundamental forces of nature, governing everything from motors to lightning to radio waves.

## Core Concepts

- The [Magnetic flux](./Magnetic%20flux.md) describes how much magnetic field passes through a surface.

- The [Ampere force](./Ampere%20force.md) applies to **current-carrying conductors** placed in a magnetic field.

- The [Lorentz force](Ampere%20force.md) applies to **charged particles** moving through electric and magnetic fields.

> [!tip]
>  These pages work together. For example, a changing magnetic flux leads to an EMF (see [Faraday’s Law](./Electromotive%20force%20and%20flux%20change.md#faradays+Law)), which connects back to the Lorentz force acting on charges in motion.
