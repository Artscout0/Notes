# Ampère Force

The **Ampère force** is the magnetic force acting on a **current-carrying conductor** placed in a magnetic field. It's essentially the macroscopic version of the Lorentz force, acting on moving charges in bulk.

## Scalar form

$$F_A = B \cdot I \cdot \Delta l \cdot \sin(\alpha)$$

Where:
- $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field \[T],
- $I$ is the current through the conductor \[A],
- $\Delta l$ is the length of the conductor in the field \[m],
- $\alpha$ is the angle between the direction of the conductor and the magnetic field,
- $F_A$ is the magnitude of the Ampère (magnetic) force \[N]

> [!warning] Beware!!
> This applies when the conductor is straight and placed in a uniform field.

## Vector form

$$\vec{F_A} = I \cdot \vec{l} \times \vec{B}$$

Where:
- $I$ is the current through the conductor \[A],
- $\vec{l}$ is the length vector of the conductor, pointing in the direction of current \[m],
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector \[T],
- $\vec{F_A}$ is the Ampère force vector \[N]

## Notes

- The **direction** of the force is given by the **right-hand rule**: point your fingers in the direction of $\vec{l}$ (current), curl them toward $\vec{B}$, and your thumb points in the direction of $\vec{F_A}$.
- If $\alpha = 0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$ (parallel/antiparallel), the force is zero.
- Maximum force occurs when the conductor is **perpendicular** to the field ($\alpha = 90^\circ$).
