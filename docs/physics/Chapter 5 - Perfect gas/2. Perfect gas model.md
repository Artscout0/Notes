This is a simple and quite effective model to describe any real gas that's far away from liquefaction.

So, our hypothesis are:
1. The different molecules don't interact.
2. The molecules don't have a volume (we suppose they are points)
3. Every choc with a molecule is perfectly elastic (with other molecules, with pistons, any containers...)

What does this get us?

Well, the law of perfect gas states $PV=NkT$, where P is the pressure of the gas, V the volume it occupies, N the **number of molecules**, T the temperature of the gas (in degrees K), as well as k, the Boltzmann constant, which is roughly $1.38\cdot10^{-23} JK^{-1}$

Another way of writing it, which is perfectly equivalent and easier to use in stuff like chemistry is $PV=nRT$. It works because $nR=Nk$, because n is a mole (a number) of molecules. In other terms, $N=nN_{A}$. $PV=nN_{a}kT$, and $N_{a}k$ is nice, because it is defined as the constant R, which is the ideal gas constant, which is also $8.31 \frac{J}{K\cdot mol} (JK^{-1}mol^{-1})$.
