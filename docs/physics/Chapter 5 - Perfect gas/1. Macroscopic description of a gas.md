A gas is formed of a set of molecules that barely interact with each other.
Each molecule has a complex movement, and it feels like describing them all would be complicated.

Luckily, we don't have to, and we can just look at their macroscopic effects.

What interests us is stuff like pressure, volume, and temperature.

So, let's model that using math!
