Imagine a simple pendulum. 

When it swings, at some point in time, it's going downwards. There's a certain speed at which it's going.
Then, when it's at the lowest point, it's going the fastest, only to start going upwards, losing the speed, and starting to go down again, and repeat.

From there, we can decide on some value, measured in Joules, that describes how much the object can move. It's called energy.

In the pendulum example, we define 2 of them, which are the important ones in dynamics: kinetic energy, and potential energy.

If we look at the entire system, we'll notice that over time, if we assume it's ideal, both it's energies remain the same, however the sum of both, the mechanical energy, remains the same.

We thus get the next law of physics:
> Energy can never be created or destroyed, only transformed.

Note that in reality, everything's a bit more complex, and the pendulum would slow down and stop eventually. Not because the law doesn't work, however because energy gets transferred to the local air, to many other things, and everywhere. This system isn't perfect.
