A conservative force is a force for which the work on the object only depends on the ends of the path.

An example would be the weight $m\vec{g}$.
At every point of the trajectory $\Gamma$, the weight is always the same (assuming this happens on earth, and the gravity is roughly the same everywhere). 

So, if we have a typical ballistic trajectory:
When going up,the weight is opposed to the trajectory, and its work is negative. 
When going down, the weight is aligned with the trajectory, meaning its work is positive.

What does this mean?
Well, between position $\vec{r}_{1}$ at instant $t_{1}$ and position $\vec{r}_{2}$ at instant $t_{2}$, the work of the weight is given by the following equation:

$W_{1\to2}(m\vec{g})=\int_{1}^{2}m\vec{g}\cdot d\vec{r_{cm}}=m\vec{g}\cdot\int_{1}^{2}d\vec{r}_{cm}$

We can take mg out of the integral as it's a constant. 

And what's nice is that the integral of all these small vectors, is the sum of all of them, so just $\vec{r}_{2}-\vec{r}_{1}$, which we'll refer to as $\vec{l}$.
This means that the work is $W_{1\to2}=m\vec{g}\cdot\vec{l}=m\vec{g}\cdot(r_{2}-r_{1})$.
This itself can be rewritten as:

$$
= -(m\vec{g}\cdot \vec{r}_{1})-(-m\vec{g}\cdot\vec{r_2})
$$

This allows us to define the potential energy (of gravity (near the earth)), briefly mentioned before.

$$E_{p.g.}(\vec{r})=-m\vec{g}\cdot\vec{r}+C$$

And this allows us to write:

$$
W_{1\to2}(m\vec{g})=E_{p.g.}(r_{1})-E_{p.g.}(r_{2})
$$


It's worth noting that, if we were to build this, we'd quickly notice that the following equation holds true:
$m\vec{g}\cdot\vec{r}=mgr\cos\alpha$

And it's quite similar to a projection of $\vec{r}$ on $\vec{e}_{y}$, which is just a vertical vector of length 1, which gives us the vertical component of $\vec{r}$, times g, which gives us the formula everyone actually uses: $E_{p.g.}(\vec{r})=mgh+C$
And thus, $W(m\vec{g})=mg(h_1-h_2)$
