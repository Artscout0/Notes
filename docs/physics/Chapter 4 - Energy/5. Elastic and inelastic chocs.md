Let's start with an example.

We drop a ball, with mass m, from height h, onto the floor.
After it has hit the floor, it bounces, to height h'. 
What does the height h' depend on?

So, during the fall, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.
At the moment of the collision, the kinetic energy is almost fully gone, then is partially given back. As energy is conserved, it's actually transformed into thermal energy and deformation.

We say the choc is elastic if the kinetic energy is fully given back (so, $E_{kin}'=E_{kin}$), which means the ball bounces back to the same height ($h'=h$)

We say it's inelastic if the kinetic energy is not fully given back ($E_{kin}'\lt E_{kin}$, and $h'\lt h$).

It can also be perfectly inelastic, in which case the two objects that collide stay together ($E_{kin}'=0, h'=0$)


## Bit of a tangent

If we look at the fairly simple case of a ball colliding with another one, and going off at some angle, we can notice some stuff we didn't previously:

1st of all, the energy part. The total kinetic energy will remain the same. This means some of the energy is transferred to the second ball. This also means :$E_{kin}'(1)+E_{kin}'(2)=K_{kin}(1)$

This means, for reasons I don't have the time to explain, that the angle between both balls will be $\frac{pi}{2}$.
