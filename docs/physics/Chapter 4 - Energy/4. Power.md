As mentioned before, in a system, the energy in one form can change over time.

We define power to be that change:

$$
P=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}= \frac{dE}{dt}=\dot{E}
$$

It's unit is Watts, it represents Joules per Second ($\frac{J}{s}$).

We can also define the efficiency of something turning energy from one form to another:

$$
\mu = \frac{P_{useful}}{P_{given}}
$$

It doesn't have a unit, and is always between 0 and 1, with 1 meaning it's perfectly efficient, which in reality typically never happens, and 0 meaning it is not. It's often given in percent (%).
