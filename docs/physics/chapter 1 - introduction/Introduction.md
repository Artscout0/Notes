## Goal of physics

From an experiment, we take measure, from which we make theories, which we use for predictions.

In other terms, we understand and describe natural phenomena through laws that are as general as possible, and as precise as needed.

An example:

### Free fall

Experience/observation: 
- An object (like a stone): it falls
- Two objects (like 2 stones): they fall in a similar way

Resulting law:
- Any object falls in this way

Objection:
- If we take a different object (like a leaf): it falls differently

So, either we reject the law, or we try to complete it, so it accounts for the leaf.

Observation 2:
- If we do this in a vacuum, the leaf falls at the same speed as the stone.

Law 2:
- Any object falls in the same way, but we sometimes need to take air resistance into account.

## Physics law, role of mathematics

We search for an equivalence between the real and the symbolic.

In other terms, math is the language of physics. 

Therefore:
- a law is a rule, in accordance with observation, that allows the prediction of future observations.
- an observation is a set of measurements of observable physical measurements
- a physical measurement is an equation between the real world and the symbolic world
- a measurement is  a comparison with a reference ($\rightarrow$ SI units)

A law is then a mathematical relation between physical measurements.

### Another free fall example

A ball of mass m and radius r is let go of (no initial speed)

So, we get measurements:
- Length (vertical) of the fall, d, in m (meters)
- Length of time of the fall, t, in s (seconds)

From this, we get the following law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
d=\frac{1}{2}gt^2
\newline
g\approx9.81\frac{m}{s^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Examples of observables related to objects

| What            | Symbol | Unit              | Definition                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Object          |        |                   | A bit of matter                                                                                                         |
| Mass            | m      | kg                | Quantity of matter of which the object is made                                                                          |
| Volume          | V      | l, $m^3$          | How much space the object takes up                                                                                      |
| Volumetric mass | $\rho$ | $\cfrac{kg}{m^3}$ | The amount of mass a specific volume will have, which is a characteristic of what the object is made of, it's materiel. |
|                 |        |                   |                                                                                                                         |

Sometimes we compare objects with some reference objects, the most common one being liquid water, typically at a specific temperature (typically 4$^{\circ}$). 
This allows us to introduce the concept of density, which the d=$\cfrac{\rho_{object}}{\rho_{water}}$ , so the volumetric mass of the object compared to the volumetric mass of water. 
As it's volumetric mass divided by volumetric mass, it doesn't have a unit.

So, some more observables:

| What         | Symbol               | Unit  | Definition                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surface area | S, $\sigma$          | $m^2$ | It's the surface area of the object.                                                        |
| Lengths      | d, h, x, y, r, s,... | $m$   | It's either one of the lengths of the object, but it can also be it's position and similar. |

## Another law example: Newton's 2nd law


We need 3 observables for  this:
- The mass m in kilograms
- The acceleration $\vec{a}$ in $m/s^2$
- The force applied on the object $\vec{F}$ in N (Newtons)

This will result in the law that $\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$.

This implies that newtons are $kg \cdot m / s^2$
