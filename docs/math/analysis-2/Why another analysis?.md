Well, some functions are a bit special, so, they have been separated into another lesson, for consistency and speed's sake.

For example, we have a lot of trigonometry to do.

>[!note]- Historical notice
> Trigonometry was initially invented for astronomy, but it has been proven useful for a variety of other tasks, most notably working with circles, and engineering.

The main program is trigonometry, and then logarithmic and exponential functions.

## Some neat stuff

### Trig

#### Useful angles

|     | $\pi/2$ | $\pi/3$      | $\pi/4$      | $\pi/6$      | 0   |
| --- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | --- |
| sin | 1       | $\sqrt{3}/2$ | $\sqrt{2}/2$ | 1/2          | 0   |
| cos | 0       | 1/2          | $\sqrt{2}/2$ | $\sqrt{3}/2$ | 1   |
| tan | //      | $\sqrt{3}$   | 1            | $\sqrt{3}/3$ | 0   |
| cot | 0       | $\sqrt{3}/3$ | 1            | $\sqrt{3}$   | //  |

#### Sum and difference identities

$cos(A-B)=cos(A)\times cos(B) + sin(A)\times sin(B)$
$cos(A+B)=cos(A)\times cos(B) - sin(A)\times sin(B)$
$sin(A+B)=sin(A)\times cos(B) + cos(A)\times sin(B)$
$sin(A-B)=sin(A)\times cos(B) - cos(A)\times sin(B)$

$tan(A+B)=\cfrac{tan(A)+tan(B)}{1-tan(A)\times tan(B)}$

$tan(A+B)=\cfrac{tan(A)-tan(B)}{1+tan(A)\times tan(B)}$
