Ok, inverting a function ins't exactly easy.

Say we have a set E and F.

If we say that E maps to F using function $f$, and say that $f=\cos$.

We'll find that E's items result in F's items, however not every item in F will result in a different result, as $\frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{\pi}{3}+2\pi...$ will result in the same value.

This mean any item outside the $]-1:1[$ range won't have a preimage, and any item in that range will have many items pointing to it.

We'll now try to fix that.

## Injection

Say we have E and F, but this time $f$ maps it so for any item in E has a distinct image.
This would mean this is injective.

We write that something is injective as:

$$
\begin{align}
\forall x, x'\in E && x\ne x' \implies f(x)\ne f(x')\\
\forall x, x'\in E && f(x) = f(x')\implies x=x'\\
\forall x \in E && f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})=\{x\}\\
\forall y \in F && \text{card }f^{-1}(\{y\})\le1
\end{align}
$$

Now, what does it mean to not be injective?

$$
\begin{align}
\exists x, x' \in E && x\ne x', f(x)=f(x')
\end{align}
$$

### Examples

1)

$E=F \text{  } f=id_{E}: x \to x$
It'san application of the identities of E.
It is injective.

2)

$c\in F,  f: E\to F, x\to c$

So, it's x maps to a constant. It's not injective, as everything is a repeat.

3)

$E=F=\mathbb{R}, f:x\to x^2$

Counter: -2 and 2.
Means it isn't.

4)

$E=F=\mathbb{N}, f:x\to x^2$

Here it is, because in R it's x and -x, but here we've only got the natural numbers.
so, $\forall n, m \in \mathbb{N}, m\ne n \implies m^{2}\ne n^{2}$.

to be strict: $n^{2}-m^{2}=(m-n)(m+n)$, and as m isn't n, 1st one isn't 0, and second one can't be, meaning this isn't 0, meaning they aren't equal.

5)

$E=F=\mathbb{R}, f:x\to x^{3}-2x^{2}+3x$

Well, this is more complex.
We haven't worked with cubics, so solving it is out of the question, so let's go with:

Well, say there is $x\in\mathbb{R}$ so that $x'\in f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})$ .

$$
\begin{align}
\iff f(x')=f(x) \\
\iff x'^3-2x^{2}+3x'=x^{3}-2x+3x\\
\iff x'^{3}-x^{3}-2(x'^{2}-x^{2})+3(x'-x)=0 \\
\iff (x'-x)(x^{2}-xx'+x'^{2})-2(x'-x)(x'+x)+3(x'-x) \\
\iff (x'-x) ((x^{2}-xx'+x'^{2})-2(x'+x)+3) \\
\iff (x'-x) (x'^{2}+x^{2}-xx'-2x'-2x+3)=0 \\
\iff (x'-x) (x'^{2}+(x-2)x'+x^{2}-2x+3)=0 \\
\text{ We have a second degree function, which we use viete for. } \\
\Delta =(x-2)^{2}-4(x^{2}-3x+3) \\
=-3x^{2}+4x-8 \\
4^{2}-4(-3)(-8) < 0 \\ 
\implies x'=x \text{ is the only solution. } \\
\forall x\in\mathbb{R}, f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})=\{x\} \\
\implies \text{Conclusion: f is injective.} \\
\end{align}
$$


### Turning injective

How to turn a function injective? Well, the issue we have is that too many elements of our sets map to the same elements in the resulting set.

Why don't we just remove them from the set? And that's exactly what we do, using something called restrictions.

Say compared to the usual example, we have $A\subset E$

E maps to F, but it isn't injective.

What we say is that A is a subset of A, so that f(A) is injective.

We note it:

$f_{|A}:A\to F, x\to f(x)$


So, erm, what's $img(f_{|a})$??

Clearly, and I hope nobody is getting lost in definitions, it's $\{f_{|A}|x\in A\}=\{f(x), x\in A\}$

Basically, the goal is to remove all the elements that result in the same things except one.

### More Examples

$E=F=\mathbb{R}, f: x\to x^{2}-5x+6$

We'll notice we have duplicate values, easily if we [map it](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wcgda1ifjh), even easier if we don't and just think about what the square implies.

Anyhow, if we solve it like last time, we get:

$$
\begin{align}
\dots\\
\iff (x'-x)(x'+x-5)=0\\
\iff x'=x \text{ or } x'=5-x
\end{align}
$$

Which means $f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})=\{x; 5-x\}$.

It isn't injective.

However, it is injective if we **restrict** the area in which it operates.

The obvious options of the restrictions are:

$f_{|[\frac{5}{2};\infty[}$, and $f_{|]\infty; \frac{5}{2}]}$

A less obvious one is $f_{|[0,1]\bigcup[6;+\infty]}$.


## Composition

The composition of $f: E\to F$ and $g: F\to G$

It's defined as follows:

$$
g\circ f: E\to G, x\to g(f(x))
$$

Basically, we turn elements from set E to set F, and from set F to set G. It's just subsequent application.
