## Points and vectors

We've previously talked in [[3. Vector study of straight lines|chapter 3]] about coordinates and R, a plane.

What if we add  another coordinate to our vectors?
We get a space.

We have therefore the exact same stuff as before, but slightly different because there's one more dimension to work with.

For example, to be colinear, we now define that vectors need to be proportional (so for vectors $\vec{u} \text{ and } \vec{v}$ respectively $\begin{bmatrix}\alpha\\ \beta\\ \gamma\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$, if $\frac{x}{\alpha}=\frac{y}{\beta}=\frac{z}{\gamma}(=t)$, then they are proportional.)

We'll also see that to have two vectors be colinear, is the same as to say:

$\begin{vmatrix}x&\alpha\\ y&\beta\end{vmatrix}=0, \begin{vmatrix}x&\alpha \\ z&\gamma\end{vmatrix}=0, \begin{vmatrix}y&\beta\\ z&\gamma\end{vmatrix}=0$

which we'll later find out means

$\begin{vmatrix}x&\alpha\\ y&\beta\\ z&\gamma\end{vmatrix}=0$


Anyhow, if we have two vectors that aren't colinear, we can define other vectors as their linear combination. The vectors defined that way are co-planar to them, written $\vec{w}\in vect(\vec{u},\vec{v})$.

You can fairly easily define that with vectors u and v, we can define variables s and t, so that $\vec{w}=s\vec{u}+t\vec{v}$. From there, you can without major issues rewrite that using columns, and from there turn it into a form that looks something like $ax+by+cz=d$, where $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}$. This is useful, as it defines a plane in 3d space (note how similar it is to a line in 2d space). [Mildly cool visualization](https://www.desmos.com/3d/rjedwu8es3).

You can check if a vector is part of that plane by plugging it's x y and z coordinates into the resulting formula.

We'll also soon discover that is the Cartesian formula of a plane.

In a reciprocal way, if we have $\vec{w}$, solution to that formula. If we know the normal vector of the plane, to check if the vector is part of it, we can just check if $\vec{w}\cdot\vec{n}=0$.


Lastly, we need to know, if $\vec{w}=(x,y,z)$:

$$\det_{R}(\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w})=\begin{vmatrix}\alpha& \lambda& x \\ \beta& \mu& y\\ \gamma& \sigma & z\end{vmatrix}= \begin{vmatrix}\beta& \mu \\ \gamma & \sigma \end{vmatrix}~x- \begin{vmatrix}\alpha & \lambda \\ \gamma& \sigma\end{vmatrix}~y+\begin{vmatrix}\alpha & \lambda \\ \beta & \mu\end{vmatrix}z$$


## Lines

A line is defined using basically the same thing as before, just with one additional parameter.

$$$d:\begin{cases}x=x_{a}+\alpha t\\ y= y_{a}+\beta t\\ z=z_{a}+\gamma t\end{cases}, t\in\mathbb{R}$$

This also allows for a nice thing, called the Cartesian equations of d, which we get by removing t.


$$
d: \frac{x-x_{a}}{\alpha}= \frac{y-y_{a}}{\beta}= \frac{z-z_{a}}{\gamma}(=t)
$$

This of course requires alpha beta and gamma to not be 0. If one of them is 0, we consider that $x=x_{a}$ (or equivalent).

If there's $\alpha=\beta$ (or equivalent cases), we can write that $x=x_{a},~ y=y_{a}$
To describe a line, we need 2 equations. Unless it's a parametric equation.

A simple example would be

$$
d: \begin{cases}x=2+3t\\ y=1-t\\ z=t\end{cases}
$$

We immediately know it passes through $(2,1,0)$, and it's directed by $\begin{bmatrix}3\\-1\\1\end{bmatrix}$.

It admits as carthesian equation an infinite number of solutions, but the basic one is

$$
d: \frac{x-2}{3}=1-y= \frac{z}{2}
$$



Lastly, is we get a line $d=(AB)$, with $A=(1,5,5), b=(-1,5,1)$

We get that $\vec{AB}=(-2,0,-4)$, or technically $\vec{u}=(1,0,2)$, is director to d.

We can thus get:

$$
d:\begin{cases}x=1+t\\ y=5\\ z=5+2t\end{cases}
$$

This means for the Cartesian equation, we have

$$
d: x-1, \frac{z-5}{2}, \text{ and } y=5
$$

And this means that in the y coordinate, this line is always parallel to $(Oxz)$ (that is to say, parallel to the plane that doesn't contain y).

There, we have the interesting cases of where d intersects (Oxy), and (Ozy). It'll however never intersect (Oxz).
