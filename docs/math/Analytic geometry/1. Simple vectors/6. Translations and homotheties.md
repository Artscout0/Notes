## Translations

Not to be confused with translating to another language, a translation by some vector $\vec{u}$ is the geometric transformation describred by:

$$t_{\vec{u}}:M\to M', \vec{MM'}=\vec{u}$$

We can note that M' is the image of M by translation $\vec{u}$

M can be a point, in which case M' will simply be the point pointed to by $\vec{u}$ starting from M.

M can be a vector, in which case nothing really important happens (as we've previously defined vectors can more or less move around).

M can be a line, in which case case we obtain the line $t_{\vec{u}}d$, or $d'$ which has the property of being parallel to line d. 

Translation is bijective, and it's inverse is $t_{-\vec{u}}$ (so translation by the opposite vector). It preserves the lengths, areas, volumes, and angles.

We're also going to need to mention the set $\{M, t_{\vec{u}}(M)=M\}$ (fixed points of $t_\vec{u}$)
We might notice the set is empty if $\vec{u}$ isn't 0, however if $\vec{u}=\vec{0}$, $t_{\vec{u}}$ is the identity, and all points are fixed.

## Homothety

Say there's a point $\Omega$ and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ 
The homothety of center $\Omega$ and rapport $\alpha$ is the geometric transformation described by 

$$h_{\Omega,\alpha}:M\to M', \vec{\Omega M'}=\alpha\vec{\Omega M}$$


The effect of homothety on a point is just moving that point $\alpha$ times further away.

It's effect on a vector is making it $\alpha$ times longer

It's effect on a line would be making a parallel line $\alpha$ times further away. 

$h_{\Omega,\alpha}$ is bijective, it's inverse is $h_{\Omega,\frac{1}{\alpha}}$
It multiplies lengths by $|\alpha|$, areas by $|\alpha|^{2}$ and volumes by $|\alpha|^{3}$. 
It preserves the angles

The set $\{M,h_{\Omega,\alpha}(M)=M\}$ is important to mention, as it's its fixed points, which is equal to $\{\Omega\}$ when $\alpha\ne1$. When it is, no movement happens and so no points move.

## Example (characterization by a rapport and a point-image couple)

Given points A and B, find $\Omega$ knowing $h_{\Omega,3}(A)=B$

The solution is:

$h_{\Omega,3}(A)=B \iff \vec{\Omega B}=3\vec{\Omega A}$

We know $\vec{\Omega B}=\vec{\Omega A}+\vec{AB}$
Which can be turned using what we know into $2\vec{\Omega A}=\vec{AB}\iff \vec{A\Omega}=\frac{1}{2}\vec{BA}$

## Analytical expressions

Say we have a reference frame $R=(O,\vec{i},\vec{j})$

**Proposition:** Say we have $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in\mathbb{R}$ with $\alpha\ne0$
The transformation F of analytical expression:

$$f:\begin{cases}x'=\alpha x+\beta\\y'=\alpha y+\beta\end{cases}\iff \binom{x'}{y'}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha&0\\0&\alpha\end{bmatrix}\binom{x}{y}+\binom{\beta}{\gamma}$$

(as mentioned in briefly in [[1. What are Matrices#Product|Linear Algebra]])

It's neat that we have $\begin{bmatrix}\alpha&0\\0&\alpha\end{bmatrix}$, as it's just $\alpha I_{2}$. 

This also gives us the following property:

$$
\begin{cases}\text{if }\alpha\text{ is 1, we have a translation}\\\text{Otherwise, we end up with a homothety} \end{cases}
$$

The proof is:
Let's note M(x,y) and M'(x',y'), with M' being f(M)

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{if } \alpha=1:\\
& M'=f(M)\iff\begin{cases}x'=x+\beta\\y'=y+\gamma\end{cases}\iff\binom{x'-x}{y'-y}=\binom{\beta}{\gamma}\\
&\iff \vec{MM'}=\vec{u} \text{ where } \vec{u}\binom{\beta}{\gamma}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

We thus see that if $\alpha$ is 1, $f=t_{\vec{u}}$.

Now, if we say $\alpha\ne1$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	f(\Omega)=\Omega\iff \begin{cases}x_\Omega=\alpha x_\omega+\beta \\ y_\Omega=\alpha y_\omega+\beta \end{cases} \iff \begin{cases}\end{cases}\iff
	\begin{cases} x_{\Omega}=\frac{\beta}{1-\alpha} \\ y_{\Omega}=\frac{\gamma}{1-\alpha} \end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Which is the same as saying $f(\Omega)=\Omega$.

We can then using M find that 
$$\binom{x'-x_{\Omega}}{y'-y_{\Omega}}=\alpha\binom{x-x_{\Omega}}{y-y_{\Omega}}\iff\Omega M=\alpha\Omega M$$
which means $f = h_{\Omega,\alpha}$

## More Examples
a. 
The formulas $\begin{cases}x'=-2x+3 \\ y'=-2y+6\end{cases}$ describe the homothety is $h_{\Omega,-2}$, where $\Omega$ is the only fixed point of coordinates (?;?):

$$
\binom{x'}{y'}=\binom{x}{y}\iff-2\binom{x}{y}+\binom{3}{6}=\binom{x}{y}\iff\binom{x}{y}=\binom{1}{2}
$$
b. 
Formulas of $h_{\Omega,3}$ where $\Omega=(-1,0)$

$M'=h_{\Omega,3}(M)\iff\vec{\Omega M'}=3\vec{\Omega M}$
$\iff\binom{x'+1}{y'}=3\binom{x+1}{y}$
$\iff\begin{cases}x'=3x+2\\y'=3y\end{cases}$


The Cartesian equation of $h_{\Omega,3}(d)$ where $d:x+y=1$

this line goes through $h_{\Omega,3}(0)(2,0)$
It has thus the equation $x+y=2$


## Composition

Let's compose expressions of the type obtained [[#Analytical expressions]].

$$
\begin{cases} x'=\lambda(\alpha x+\beta)+\mu \\ y'=\lambda(\alpha y+\gamma)+\rho\end{cases}
\iff \begin{cases}x'=\lambda\alpha x+\lambda\beta+\mu \\ y'=\lambda\alpha y+\lambda\gamma+\rho\end{cases}
$$

We can like this say that this transformation family is stable by composition. 

We can easily find the following:

$$\begin{matrix}t_\vec{v}\circ t_{\vec{u}}=t_{\vec{v}+\vec{u}} && t_{\vec{v}}\circ h_{\Omega,\alpha}=h_{?,\alpha}\\ h_{\Delta,\lambda}\circ t_{\vec{u}}=h_{?,\lambda} && h_{\Delta,\lambda}\circ h_{\Omega,\alpha}=\begin{cases}\lambda\alpha=1\implies t_{?}\\\lambda\alpha\ne1\implies h_{?,\lambda\alpha}\end{cases}\end{matrix}$$

So here's the nature of all this.

Now, the rapport isn't difficult, however the center isn't easy.
Luckily, there's 2 ways to find it, geometrically and analytically.
