## Geometric meaning

Say $\Omega$ is a point and $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$. The rotation of center $\Omega$ by angle $\theta$ is the geometric transformation described by

$$
r_{\Omega,\theta}:M\to M', \begin{cases}||\vec{\Omega M}||=||\vec{\Omega M'}||\\\\\text{The angle between } \vec{\Omega M}\text{ and } \vec{\Omega M'} =\theta\end{cases}
$$

As you can probably guess by now, having read the [[6. Translations and homotheties|previous note]] and what not, that M can be a point, a vector, of a line.
Unlike translations, this does actually affect the vector, but unlike homotheties it only changes it's direction.
Same with lines, where one of the angles between the original and new line is going to be $\theta$ as well. 

It's bijective, it's inverse is $r_{\Omega,-\theta}$. It's result's length surfaces and angles will be the same as those of the original figure.

It's got a single point that won't rotate, which is $\Omega$, unless $\theta=2\pi k,k\in\mathbb{Z}$

Also notice that if $M\ne M'\implies \Omega\in\text{ mediatrice of } MM'$

## Analytical meaning

Let's take all the notations from before, and put them in a plane with a reference $(O,\vec{i},\vec{j})$, which is direct orthonormal.

The rotation $r_{O,\theta}$ can be described as

$$\begin{cases}x'=x\cos(\theta)-y\sin(\theta)\\ y'=x\sin(\theta)+y\cos(\theta)\end{cases}\iff\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}cos(\theta)&-\sin(\theta)\\\sin(\theta)&\cos(\theta)\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}$$

This can be explained only really with a lot of drawings. Luckily a couple years back I watched a video on the topic at like 2am, so here's the link to all it's parts.
- [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9OWnuarYuc)
- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYYjci2Qpw)
- [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scpzKIe6iZw)

The tldr from this in the actual lesson is:

You can represent $\vec{OM'}$ as $\vec{OM}$ with a different i and j base vectors, which we can figure out are just i rotated by $\theta$ and $\theta+ \frac{\pi}{2}$, which we can turn by using some trigonometric properties into the previous equations and from there matrix.

To determine a matrix is a rotation matrix, it's simple-but-mildly-annoying to detect, as they all look as follows: 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}\alpha&\gamma\\\beta&\delta\end{bmatrix} \text{ where } \alpha=\delta, \beta=-\gamma, \alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}=1
$$

Proof is left as an exercise to the reader (spoiler, it's in the definition)

### Examples

the matrix of $\theta=\pi$:

$$\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\pi)&\sin(\pi)\\\sin(\pi)&\cos(\pi)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-1&0\\0&-1\end{bmatrix}$$
Which is an interesting matrix.

It results in $x'=-x$ and $y'=-y$

The matrix of $\theta=\frac{pi}{2}$:

$$\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\frac{\pi}{2})&\sin(\frac{\pi}{2})\\\sin(\frac{\pi}{2})&\cos(\frac{\pi}{2})\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$$

It results in $x'=-y$ and $y'=x$

## Analytical meaning - general case

Same variables as the previous two parts.

If we say $\theta, \lambda, \mu\in\mathbb{R}$, the transformation expressed as:
$f:\begin{cases}x'=x\cos(\theta)-y\sin(\theta)+\lambda \\ y'=x\sin(\theta)+y\cos(\theta)+\mu\end{cases}\iff \binom{x'}{y'}=R_{\theta}\binom{x}{y}+\binom{\lambda}{\mu}$

If $\theta \mathrel{\vdots} 2\pi$ , it's the same as $t_{\vec{u}}$ where $\vec{u}\binom{\lambda}{\mu}$
Otherwise, it's it's a rotation $r_{\Omega,\theta}$

The proof is that the case of theta being divisible by 2 pi is in the previous note. 
As for the second part, we know it contains a single fixed point, that is to say $\Omega$.

We can prove Omega is $\binom{\lambda}{\mu}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f(\Omega)=\Omega\iff I_{2}\binom{x_\Omega}{y_{\Omega}}=R_{\theta}+\binom{\lambda}{\mu}\iff\\
(I_{2}-R_{\theta})\binom{x_{\Omega}}{y_{\Omega}}=\binom{\lambda}{\mu}\iff\\
\binom{x_{\Omega}}{y_{\Omega}}=(I_{2}-R_{\theta})^{-1}\binom{\lambda}{\mu}
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$

Now luckily, we know that $I_{2}-R_{\theta}$ is reversible:

$$
det(I_{2}-R_\theta)=\begin{bmatrix}1-\cos(\theta)&\sin(\theta)\\-\sin(\theta)&1-\cos(\theta)\end{bmatrix}=(1-\cos(\theta))^{2}+sin(\theta)^{2}
$$

and we know both values are positive.

We thus find for M(x,y) an M'(x',y'):

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
M'=f(M)\iff \binom{x'}{y'}=R_{\theta}\binom{x}{y}+\binom{\lambda}{\mu}\\
\iff\binom{x'-x_{\Omega}}{y'-y_{\Omega}}=R_{\theta}\binom{x-x_{\Omega}}{y-y_{\Omega}}\\
\iff \text{ You can obtain } \vec{OM'} \text{ by turning } \vec{OM} \text{ by } \theta\\
\iff M'=r_{\Omega,\theta}(M)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

### TLDR

You can get the formula for $r_{\Omega,\theta}$ is 

$r_{\Omega,\theta}(M)=\begin{bmatrix}x'\\ y'\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha&\gamma\\\beta&\delta\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_{M}-x_{\Omega}\\ y_{M}-y_{\Omega}\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}x_{\Omega}\\y_{\Omega}\end{bmatrix}$

where $\delta=\alpha, \gamma=-\beta, \alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}=1$
