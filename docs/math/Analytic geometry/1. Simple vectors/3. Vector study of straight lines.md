Say we have a point O, $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}\ne\vec{0}$, two vectors. 


$$
d: \overrightarrow{OM}=\vec{u}+t\vec{v}, t\in\mathbb{R}
$$

Specifically, this is the vector equation of d seen from O. 
If you draw this, you'll see that $\vec{u}$ points to a point, and from there $\vec{v}$ points, by virtue of being multiplied by any real number, to a set of points, one of which is M. M is considered a mobile point, meaning it can be any point we want, in this case any point on the line.


This also warrants the introduction of a new term: a couple.

$$
R=(A,\vec{v})
$$

A being a point of d, and $\vec{v}$ being the director vector of d.
It's a way to also find d.

The parameter t of the abscissa of M in R, is found by

$$
t=\frac{||\overrightarrow{AM}||}{||\vec{v}||}
$$

As an example, say we have the triangle ABC, we need to draw $d:\overrightarrow{BM}=\overrightarrow{BA}+t\overrightarrow{AC},t\in\mathbb{R}$. That would simply be the line of which AC is part of. The line $g:\overrightarrow{BM}=\overrightarrow{CB}+t\overrightarrow{AB}$ is the line // to AB, of which the point B+$\overrightarrow{AC}$ is part of.
If we need $h=\overrightarrow{AM}=\frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{AB}+t\overrightarrow{BC}$ is a line // to BC, that passes through the midpoint between A and B.

## Intersections

One thing we will oft need to find will be the intersections of these lines. 

How do?

Well, say we need to find the intersection I of the lines g and h. 
We will likely be given a point from which to observe it, here we say point B (related to previous example)

What we have from that is the following:

$$
\begin{cases}
g: \overrightarrow{BM}=\overrightarrow{CB}+k\overrightarrow{AB},t\in\mathbb{R}\\
h: \overrightarrow{BM}=\frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{BA}+t\overrightarrow{BC}
\end{cases}
$$

for I = M, we obtain the following:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\overrightarrow{BI}=\overrightarrow{CB}+t\overrightarrow{AB}=\frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{BA}+s\overrightarrow{BC}\\
\iff (t+\frac{1}{2})\overrightarrow{AB}=(s+1)\overrightarrow{BC}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

As AB and BC aren't colinear:

$$
\begin{cases}
t+\frac{1}{2}=0\\
s+1=0
\end{cases}
\iff
\begin{cases}
t=-\frac{1}{2}\\
s=-1
\end{cases}
$$

which means $\overrightarrow{BI}=\frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{BA}-\overrightarrow{BC}$.



As an exercise for the reader, find the equations for the median from point A looking from point C.

> [!Note]- Solution
>  $d:\vec{CM}=\vec{CA}+t(\frac{1}{2}\vec{CB}-\vec{CA})$

As a better exercise for the reader, find the center of gravity of the triangle (as in where all the medians collide).
