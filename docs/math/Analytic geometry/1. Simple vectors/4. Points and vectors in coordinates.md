## Frame

The coordinate frame in a plane is defined using 3 things: $R=(O, \vec{i}, \vec{j})$, where O is the origin, i and j are non-colinear base vectors.

We say the frame is orthonormal if $||\vec{i}||=||\vec{j}||=1$ and $\vec{i}\cdot\vec{j}=0$


## Coordinates

Once a plane has a frame, vectors and points receive coordinates, noted: $\vec{u}=\binom{x}{y}=x\vec{i}+y\vec{j}$, and $P=(x_{p}, y_{p}),\vec{OP}=x_{p}\vec{i}+y_{p}\vec{j}$. 

An addition between the vectors $\vec{v}=\binom{x}{y}$ and $\vec{v}=\binom{x'}{y'}$ is $\vec{u}+\vec{v}=\binom{x+x'}{y+y'}=(x+x')\vec{i}+(y+y')\vec{j}$

Multiplication by a scalar will be: $t\vec{u}=t\binom{x}{y}=tx\vec{i}+ty\vec{j}$

To find a point between 2 points is also easy: $(\frac{x_{m}+x_{n}}{2}; \frac{y_{m}+y_{n}}{2})$ (where m and n are the points).


A small example:

In $R=(O,\vec{i},\vec{j})$, we're given $A=(0,5), B=(4,3), C=(2,1)$

We need to find: $\vec{AB}$, $\vec{AC}$, $\frac{1}{2}\vec{AC}$

$\vec{AB}=\binom{4-0}{3-5}=\binom{4}{-2}$
$\vec{AC}=\binom{2}{-4}$
$\frac{1}{2}\vec{AC}= \frac{1}{2}\binom{2}{-4}=\binom{1}{-2}$


If we were to change R to be $(O, \vec{i}+\vec{j},\vec{i})$

Here, we have: $x(\vec{i}+\vec{j})+y\vec{i}$, and we know it was before $4\vec{i}+3\vec{j}$.

Solving this is not exactly impossible: $x(\vec{i}+\vec{j})+y\vec{i}=(x+y)\vec{i}+x\vec{j}$

This turns into $x+y=4$ and $x=3$ which we calculate to be $x=3, y=1$.


## Scalar product, again

So, we defined the scalar product to be: $||\vec{u}||\times||\vec{v}||\times\cos(\alpha)$. 

In reality, there's an easier way to do this, if we're given the vectors are column vectors.

$$
\vec{u}=\binom{x}{y}, \vec{v}=\binom{x'}{y'}, \vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=xx'||\vec{i}||+yy'||\vec{j}||+(xy'+yx')\vec{i}\vec{j}
$$

However, if we're in an orthonormal coordinate frame, it simplifies itself to be:

$$
\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=xx' + yy'
$$

We also can simplify the calculation of $||\vec{u}||$, we can turn it from $\sqrt{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}}$ to $\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$.

We also have the geometric angle that changes a bit, which we can now calculate as $\frac{xx'+yy'}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\sqrt{x'^{2}+y'^{2}}}$.

Lastly, orthogonal vectors to $\vec{u}$ of norm $||\vec{u}||$ can be simply be $\vec{u}'_{1}=\binom{-x}{y}$ or $\vec{u}'_{2}=\binom{x}{-y}$.

## Area and orientation

We can note an angle $\theta\in]-\pi;\pi[$, the orientation of $\vec{u}$ towards $\vec{v}$.

We define $\sigma(\vec{u},\vec{v})$ as $\pm$ the area of the parallelogram formed by $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$. If $\theta$ is positive (aka turning in the trigonometric direction), the area is positive. If it's turning clockwise ($\theta$ is negative), the area is negative.


## The determinant of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$

We call the determinant of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, written $\det(\vec{u},\vec{v})=\begin{vmatrix}x&&x'\\ y && y'\end{vmatrix}=xy'-yx'$

Now, we suggest for a direct orthonormal plane R, $\sigma(\vec{u},\vec{v})=\det_{R}(\vec{u},\vec{v})$

Proof will not be provided, but this is correct.

Now, by definition $\frac{xy'-yx'}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\sqrt{x'^{2}y'^{2}}}=\sigma\frac{\vec{u},\vec{v}}{||\vec{u}||||\vec{v}||}=\sin\theta$

$|xy'-yx'|$ is the non oriented area of the parallelogram. 

Through a convoluted series of steps, we will find the following:

$$
\begin{vmatrix}x&&y\\ y && -x\end{vmatrix}<0, \ \ \ \begin{vmatrix}x&&-y\\ y && x\end{vmatrix}>0, 
$$

This allows us to say that, if the determinant is lesser than 0, $\vec{u}$ is turned by/towards $- \frac{\pi}{2}$, and for if it's greater it's turned by/towards $\frac{\pi}{2}$. 

If we have $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, where $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=0$, we can find in which direction v is pointing towards by using the determinant like this.

It's also worth noting that this characterization of colinearity is correct for any frame R.
