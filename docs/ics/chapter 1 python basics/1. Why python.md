We also don't have to install it, as we can use the web platform [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch), that uses, for those who know Jupyter notebooks, that besides code allow you to write markdown, which is also incidentally what I use to take these notes. Kind of.

If you want to install it, you can. How depends on what OS you're on, if you're on Linux I doubt you need help, on windows the windows store has a copy.

To program in it, you need to either use an IDE, or a terminal if you're a psycho.
