Python is executed line by line, from top to bottom.

So something like

```python
print("1")
print("bob")
print(3)
```

will output

```md
1
bob
3
```


Python has comments, to put one '#' (pound, hash, or hashtag, depends of how Bri'ish you are), which are ignored when the code is run:

```python
print("1") # print('1.5')
# print("2")
print("3")
```

will output

```md
1
3
```

Objects in python are things that have data. 

Variables are a thing (well, object) that stores data (people who know better shut up, this is a good explanation for beginners).

To declare a variable, you do the following:

```python
n = 13 # you declare a variable named n, which is equal to 13.
n = n - 1 # here, you assign to the same variable, overriding the value there previously, and replace it with n - 1, in other terms you reduce the value by one, making it 12.
print('n')
print(n)

n = "bob" # You can also completely override variables.
print(n)
```

```md
n
12
bob
```

A variable will have a type, the common ones are:

| name     | what                                                   | example          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| int      | An integer, so something in $\mathbb{Z}$               | 1,2,-45          |
| float    | A floating point integer, so something in $\mathbb{R}$ | 35.0, $\pi$, 0.5 |
| string   | Some text                                              | "Hello world!"   |
| bool     | A boolean value, so true or false                      | True, False      |
| NoneType | None, so nothing.                                      | None             |

## Numbers

There are two types of numbers: ints, and floats. 

Ints are whole, floats are not.

Using +, -, \*, /, \*\*, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and exponentiate two numbers.

The output will depend on your input, with +, -, \*, and \*\* returning ints if both inputs are ints, however / will always return floats. 
You can also use // to get a whole division, which always returns an int, and % which returns the remainder of the division.

## Texts

You can "add" (concactenate) two stings:

```py
print("a" + "B")
```
```md
aB
```

You can "multiply" a string by an integer
```py
print("a"*5)
```
```md
aaaaa
```



## Print

`print()`, as mentioned before, writes what's in it's parentheses.

It works with most basic python types, and some more advanced ones. 
However, it won't always be able to print everything as you want it, although it will do exactly what you tell it to.

When called, it returns `None`.

print, technically all strings, but still, has so called escape characters, which are comprised of "\\" and some other character.
\\\\ is a backslash, \t is a tab, \n is a new line, \' is a single quote, and \" is a double quote.
These are the most important ones.

print also has the extra argument end, which by default is \n, which is appended to the end of the output (so by default it makes a new line at every print).

## Casting
Types can be annoying, so python often tries to cast an object from it's current type to the 'wanted' type.

the `float()` function tries turning what you gave it into a, you guessed it, float.
the `int()` into an integer
the `str()` into a string
etc...

Python often, but not always, tries to cast into the correct type. Sometimes it fails, so be careful.

An example is `print()`, which automatically casts what you give it into a string.

## Functions

Functions are a predetermined set of instructions, often with input variables (parameters) that determine what the function does exactly, and an output.
