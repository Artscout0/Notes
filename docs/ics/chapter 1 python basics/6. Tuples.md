A tuple is an object, made up of many smaller objects.

It isn't necessary that a tuple would have smaller objects that are all the same type, however in most cases that's not a good idea.

their syntax is comma separated values in parentheses.
```python
tup = (1,2,"text",6.0)
```

to access stuff, you have two options:
```python
coords = (1,2,3)
x, y, z = coords

# Is equivalent to

x = coords[0]
y = coords[1]
z = coords[2]
```

The second one is a simple case of accessing by index, the first is called tuple unpacking.

It's also what happens when you use multiple assignation, python packs variables separated by commas into a tuple, and if you assign that to some variables, it's going to unpack that tuple into it's separated into the correct variables in order. That's also what happens when you return multiple things from a function.

This also gives us a nice thing to use with functions: an arbitrary number of args.

Specifically, we can use the following syntax:

```python
def mul_param_func(*params):
	print(params)
	print(len(params))
	
mul_param_func("text")
mul_param_func("text", "text2")
mul_param_func("t","e","x","t")
```
```markdown
('text',)
1
('text', 'text2')
2
('t', 'e', 'x', 't')
4
```

>This is a good thing to use, however be weary, as you'll need to provide the function with the parameter name when assigning unless you want it to be aggregated into \*params

Oh, and you can iterate on tuples. It's neat.
