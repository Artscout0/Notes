We currently were using the program in a very simple way, going from top to bottom, doing math.

What if we want to jump around, and make it do stuff depending on other stuff?
Well, for that we use many things, of which we will now learn `if`.

`if` is a keyword, that'll, depending on if the value after it is true or false, execute the next bit of code or not.

Example:

```python
x= 4
if x < 5:
	print(f"{x} is less than 5")
```

Now, say we want something to happen if the value in front of it is False?

For that, we have the `else` keyword.

```python
x= 4
if x < 5:
	print(f"{x} is less than 5")
else:
	print(f"{x} is greater or equal to than 5")
```

Lastly, say want to check another condition first, before going to the else?

For that, we have `elif`

```python
x= 4
if x < 5:
	print(f"{x} is less than 5")
if x == 5
	print(f"{x} is equal to 5")
else:
	print(f"{x} is greater than 5")
```

Now, you might have noticed I said True or False, and wrote some `<` and `==`.

These are called boolean operators, they are operators that return booleans. There are many of them.
Specifically, this a boolean operator will evaluate to and become either True or False, and replace what they're evaluating. So

```python
b = 3 < 4
print(b)
```

outputs

```md
True
```
