Python functions can come from multiple places:

- Built in (think `print`)
- The file you're in
- The file next to it
- Standard libraries
- Created by others, and then installed

When you import stuff, there are a couple of ways, and they change how you call them.

| No  | Import method                      | Call                     |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1.  | `from module_name import function` | `function()`             |
| 2.  | `from module_name import *`        | `function()`             |
| 3.  | `import module_name`               | `module_name.function()` |
| 4.  | `import module_name as alias`      | `alias.function()`       |

Number 1 and 2 can be dangerous, as if you install functions like that, if you have a function named like that already, the module will override it.
3 and 4 are therefore generally preferred.


Example:

```py
import math
import random

def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
	"returns the distance between two points"
	return math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)

x1 = random.randint(0, 8)
x2 = random.randint(0, 8)
x3 = random.randint(0, 4)
x4 = random.randint(0, 4)

print(f"p1 ({x1}, {y1})\np2 ({x2}, {y2})")

print("distance", distance(x1, y1, x2, y2))
```
