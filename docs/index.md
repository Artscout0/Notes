# Welcome to the notes

## Modus Operandi

I write notes during lessons, typically in English but some French can get mixed in sometimes.

Through this, everyone can access them. If you notice an error, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Artscout0/Notes/issues), send me an [email](mailto:tribistomass@gmail.com), text, or just tell me. Issues are preferred.

> If you can contribute to this, you can clone the repository, make a branch, and a pull request, and I'll then eventually review and maybe merge it. Branch name must be the topic of the edit.

## TODO

- Add something to the CI/CD pipeline that'll translate potential Obsidian md into mkdocs md
- Automatic translations to french (and other langs as necessary) using some API
