# Welcome to my notes

## Modus Operandi

I write notes during lessons, typically in english but some french can get mixed in sometimes.

Through this, everyone can access them. If you notice an error, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Artscout0/Notes/issues), send me an email, text, or just tell me. Issues are preffered.

If you can contribte to this, you can clone the repository, make a branch, and a pull request, and I'll then eventually review and maybe merge it.

Branch name must be the topic of the edit.
