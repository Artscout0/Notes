# Welcome to my notes

You can navigate pages by using the navigation bar

## Modus Operandi

I write notes during lessons, typically in English but some French can get mixed in sometimes.

Through this, everyone can access them. If you notice an error, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Artscout0/Notes/issues), send me an email, text, or just tell me. Issues are preferred.

If you can contribute to this, you can clone the repository, make a branch, and a pull request, and I'll then eventually review and maybe merge it. Branch name must be the topic of the edit.
For a smoother editing experience, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is recommended, just know that you'll need to give the filename a `# title` to make it work properly[^1].

[^1]: Obsidian is a neat platform, and it generally good for note taking, that's why I suggest it. Unfortunately, it's syntax differs a bit from mkdocs - material, which I am using for the website, but not enough for it to be too problematic most of the time

## TODO

Add something to the CI/CD pipeline that'll translate potential Obsidian md into mkdocs md
