# Welcome to the notes

You can navigate pages by using the navigation bar on the side, or the sidebar if you're on the phone. 

## Modus Operandi

I write notes during lessons, typically in English but some French can get mixed in sometimes.

Through this, everyone can access them. If you notice an error, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Artscout0/Notes/issues), send me an [email](mailto:tomass.tribis@epfl.ch), text, or just tell me. Issues are preferred.

Don't rely only on this, I am not perfectly reliable for this sort of stuff. My recommendation is take your own notes, compare them with whatever I wrote here, and adjust accordingly. 

But do what you want, I can't exactly do anything about it.

## Mildly useful tables

(the capitals that look like Latin ones are the Latin ones. It's stupid.)

## How this works

This uses 2 things, python and markdown.
Specifically, it uses the python library / tool mkdocs, that allows me to take markdown files and turn them into a website (well, kind of). To write down math formulas, this uses $\LaTeX$, specifically through the MathJax library.

From there on, I use github to host all of that, and put it on the internet (hence why the .github.io in the url)

To take the notes I used Obsidian.
